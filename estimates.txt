RPO & RTO for single AZ outage:
-------------------------------
In case of single AZ outage, the chances of data loss are negligible since due to multi-AZ setup, failover happens automatically.
Hence, ideally, RPO should be near zero. An RPO of 1 minute is reasonable.
Minimum RTO can be assumed to be 2 minutes considering switchover to RDS instance in different AZ.  

RPO & RTO for single region outage: 
-----------------------------------
In case of single region outage, the following factors needs to be considered for calculating RPO:
 1. Replica lag/network latency between source & destination regions 
 2. The replication is asynchronous between source & destination regions.
 3. Promotion of read replica is manual process.
 4. Low time to recover as read replica has running DB instance

Considering the above, minimum RPO can be assumed to be 5 min.

Minimum RTO for single region outage can be arrived at as follows: 
00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert reaches on-call staff (1 minute)
00:15 - On-call staff logs in (9 minutes)
00:20 - On-call staff starts troubleshooting (5 minutes)
00:30 - Root cause analysis is done (10 minutes)
00:35 - Remediation starts (5 minutes)
00:40 - Remediation completes (10 minutes)
   As per above, minimum RTO for single region outage is assumed to be 40 min.
